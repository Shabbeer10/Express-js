## Why I'm Learning Express.js

Express.js is a powerful framework for building web applications and APIs with Node.js. As I learn to become a full-stack developer before I get into Data Engineering, mastering Express.js is essential for creating robust backend services, handling routing, middleware, and integrating with databases.

## Topics Covered So Far

Here’s a list of topics I’ve learned and am currently exploring:

- **Express.js Basics**: Setting up an Express server, understanding the project structure
- **Routing**: Defining routes, handling different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- **Middleware**: Using built-in middleware, creating custom middleware functions
- **Template Engines**: Integrating view engines like EJS, Pug
- **Handling Requests and Responses**: Parsing request bodies, sending responses
- **Static Files**: Serving static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors and implementing error-handling middleware
- **RESTful API Development**: Building CRUD APIs with Express.js
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing user authentication (basic concepts)
- **Connecting to Databases**: Integrating with MongoDB using Mongoose
- **Environment Variables**: Managing configuration with `.env` files
- **Deploying Express Applications**: Basics of deploying to platforms like Heroku

As I continue learning, I’ll update this list with new topics.
